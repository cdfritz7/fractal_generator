This project was for making some nice fractal art.

fractals.py makes circular fractals, while treeFractals.py makes (you guessed it)
tree fractals.

Mess around with the recursive calls in these two files' main if statements
to see what you can make! Change the SAVE_DIR variable to save your project.

The ./outputs/ directory has some examples of what you can make.
